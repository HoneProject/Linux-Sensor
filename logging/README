INTRODUCTION

honeread is an example reader/logger for the Hone Linux sensor.  It
demonstrates reading from /dev/hone using both read(2)/write(2) and splice(2)
as well as using ioctl(3p) to set the snaplen and to notify the sensor to
terminate the file.  honeread can also be used to read /dev/honet.


DOWNLOADING

You can get the source code by cloning the repository or by downloading a zip
file from Github:

https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor


BUILDING

From within the Hone sensor source tree, just run make.  If building out of
tree, set HONEDIR to the full path where honeevent.h is found.


USAGE

After building, run `./honeread --help` for advanced usage.  Basic usage is to
run honeread with one argument, the file where the output should be written.
The output will be written to standard out (stdout) by default, which is
probably not a great idea when reading from /dev/hone since it is a binary
file, but it allows one to easily pipe the output into another program.

The Hone sensor kernel driver must be loaded before attempting to log with
honeread as it attaches to the device implemented in the driver.


LICENSE

honeread is covered under the same license as the sensor, GPL version 2.
